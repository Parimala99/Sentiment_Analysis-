# Sentiment_Analysis-

These are some basic case studies on text summarization , POS Tagging , Key word specification , Sentiment analysis on Tweets.

All these projects are pretty self explainatory.

1. In Hate tweets detection , I have used a labeled data called train
2. In keyword specification and text summarization , I have used News library in python and scraped a news article from the url.
3. In sentiment analysis of tweets , I have collected data from Twitter API , For which one will haveto first request for developer access on Twitter platform and provide your own access and key token to get data.
